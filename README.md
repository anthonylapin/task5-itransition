Task number 5.

On any of "our" 4 platforms to choose from, you need to develop a Web application for playing tic-tac-toe online.

When entering the application on the main page, two functions are available to the user: join the game (started games are shown as "tiles" on the main page, it should be possible to filter the game by the tag cloud) and start a new game (the user specifies the name as a string, tags and makes first move).

After starting or joining, the user goes to the display with the game. Players take turns making moves (after joining the game, the game becomes inaccessible to others, only two play). When the opponent moves, the move is displayed immediately (websockets). After one of the players wins or draws, the result is shown in the form of a pop-up message, after which the players are redirected to the main page.

When you enter tags, autocompletion must be supported (from those tags that have already been used on the site).
